Five Dysfunctions of a Team
Patrick Lencioni

## Summary

The primary role of the leader in overcoming these dysfunctions is to lead by example and set the tone for the whole team. This includes being the first one to be vulnerable, encouraging debate and conflict, making responsibilities and deadlines clear, setting the team’s standards, and last but not least being clear on the team’s results.

## Five Dysfunctions

1. Absense of Trust
    * Team unable to show weaknesses
    * Time and energy invested in defensive behaviours
    * Reluctant to ask for help
2. Fear of Conflict
    * Lack of trust means that unfiltered, passionate debate is not possible > Inferior decisions made
    * Conflict is productive
3. Lack of Commitment
    * Without conflict, team members cannot commit and buy-in to decisions > ambiguity prevails
        * People will buy-in when they are part of the decision making process
    * Productive teams makes joint and transparent decisions
        * Makes sure everyone is heard
4. Avoidance of Accountability
    * When teams don't commit, you can't have accountability
        * Well functioning teams hold each other responsible
    * Key to success is the measurement of progress
5. Inattention to Results
    * Team can only become results orientated when all team members place the team results first
    * When there is no accountability, team members look after individual results
    * Make team results clear and reward the behaviours that contribute to the team's results
