## Information and Emotion

The annoying habits are all about sharing or withholding information or emotion

Always ask the questions:

* Is it appropriate?
* How much should I convey?

# Feedback

## Unsolicited Feedback

Find the knowledge which is unknown to us but known to others.

## Observational Feedback

* Make a list of people's casual remarks about you
    * Review the list as positives or negatives
    * Search for persisting negatives
* Turn the sound off
    * Look for physical behaviour
* Complete the sentence
    * Pick one thing you want to get better at
    * List the positive benefits that will accrue if you reach that goal
    * When benefits turn to something personal and meaningful then you have confirmation that this is the right thing to fix
* Listen to your self-aggrandising remarks
    * Believe the opposite of any self-aggrandising or self-deprecating remarks
* Look homeward
    * Flaws at work don't vanish when you go home

# Subtle Arts

## Apologise

* I'm sorry.
* I'll try to do better in the future.
* (Nothing more)

## Advertise

1. Assess the situation
2. Isolate the problem
3. Formulate
4. Go up > Get your superiors to approve
5. Go sideways > Get your peers to agree
6. Go down > Get your direct reports to accept
7. Implement

## Listen

* Think before you speak
* Listen with respect
* Ask yourself "Is it worth it?"

The ability to make the person you are listening to feel like they are the only person in the room is what separates the great from the near-great.

## Thank

* Write thank you notes
* Give yourself an A+ in gratitude

## Follow Up

1. Not everyone responds to development
2. There is an enormous disconnect between learning and doing
3. People don't get better without follow-up
4. Becoming better is a process, not an event

### Nightly Follow-Up Routine

1. How much walking did I do?
2. How many push-ups?
3. How many sit-ups?
4. Did you eat any high-fat foods?
5. How much alcohol did you drink?
6. How many hours did you sleep?
7. How much screen time (TV/internet/phone) did you have?
8. How much time did you spend writing?
9. Did you do something nice for your wife?
10. Did you do something nice for your kids?
11. How many times did you try to prove you were right when it wasn't worth it?
12. How many minutes did you spend on topics which didn't matter or that you couldn't control?

## Feed Forward

1. Pick a behaviour which would make a significant positive benefit in your life
2. Describe this objective in a one-to-one dialogue with someone you know
3. Ask this person for two suggestions to help achieve this objective
4. Listen attentively to the suggestions. Only response allowed is "Thank you"

# Special Challenges for People in Charge

* Stop checking the box > Follow-up
* Stop being prejudiced about your employees
    * "I know what they want"
    * "I know what they know"
    * "I hate their selfishness"
    * "I can always get someone else"

# What We Really Want

* Happiness
* Relationships
* Following dreams
* Meaning
