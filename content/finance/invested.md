Danielle Town & Phil Town  

## Rule No. 1

Don't lose money

## Inflation

* Low inflation:
    * Consumers spend > creates jobs & increases wages
* High inflation:
    * Money is quickly devalued > jobs & wages can't keep up
    * Company revenue & earnings rise > drive stock market

## Your Number

How much money you have to save before you can quit your job if you want to.

* Account for inflation (~3% p.a.)

## Four Components to FI

1. Minimum annual spending
2. Years remaining to invest
3. Money to invest
4. Required rate of return on the investment

## First Rule of Value Investing

### Value Investing

* Find a business you really like

* Wait for your favourite businesses to go on sale
* Buy
* Wait for the economic cycle to increase earnings and bring prices back to their value
* Sell

### Events

### Shiller P/E

Total market price of the S&P 500 divided by the cyclically and inflation-adjusted earnings of the S&P 500 over the past ten years

* Average Shiller P/E over 140 years is 16.4
* Risen above 25 only 3 times:
    * 1929 > 32 > market crash of 90%
    * 2000 > 40 > market crash of 50%
    * Now > 31 > ???
* Doesn't indicate a market crash

**Indicates market is badly mispriced**

### Buffett Indicator

Ratio between the market as a whole and national revenue

* Wilshire GDP ratio found [here](http://fred.stlouisfed.org)
    * Wilshire 5000 / US GDP
    * ~60% means under priced
    * >100% means over priced

3. Sales / Revenue
4. Operating Cash
    * Actual cash from business operations

* Like to see each growing at 10% p.a.
    * Most important is that it is consistent and predictable
    * If down any year, find out why

## Practice Investing

* XLS with company, date purchased, price, number of shares

## Charlie's Four Principle: Pricing

Find a price that 1) makes sense 2) is on sale > Margin of Safety

### Pricing 1: Ten Cap

```Cap rate = the amount of money that can go into the owners pocket without affecting business == Owner Earnings```

* Buffett and Munger need 10% p.a. Cap Rate > Ten Cap

#### Owner Earnings

``` Math
Net Income*
+ Depreciation & Amortisation
+ Net Change: Accounts Receivable*
+ Net Change: Accounts Payable*
+ Income Tax
+ Maintenance Capital Expenditures**

* Could be positive or negative
** Always negative
```

### Pricing 2: Payback Time

```Payback Time = Number of years it takes to get the purchase price back```

```Payback Time Buy Price = Free cash flow, grown by the compounded Windage Growth Rate for 8 years```

* Why 8 years?
    * Fair price is about half what the same company would sell for as a public company
    * Public companies sell for about 12-20 years of free cash flow > 16 yrs on average
    > 16/2 > 8 years

#### Free Cash Flow

``` Math
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
+ Purchase of Property and Equipment (negative)
+ Any other CAPEX for Maintenance and Growth (negative)
= Free Cash Flow
```
