## Rich Dad, Poor Dad

* The rich buy assets.

* The middle class buy liabilities they think are assets.

## The Lesson

Rule #1:
* Know the difference between an asset and a liability, and buy assets

### Income Statement

    * Wages, income from assets
* Expenses

### Balance Sheet

### Why the Rich Get Richer

* Assets generate enough income to cover expenses, with the balance reinvested into more assets
* Assets continue to grow

* As wages increase, so do taxes
* Expenses tend to increase with wage increases
* Treat home as asset (when it is a liability), instead of investing in assets
