## 3 Ways to Build a Great Portfolio (Based on what others are doing)

* Clone your gurus and look at what they are buying
* Buy "Cannibal Companies"
  * Companies that are eating themselves, taking their excess cash and buying their own stock
  * Investors who own the company own a bigger piece of the company without having to buy any more stock and increasing their ownership
* Buy companies that are spinning off of their own companies
  * You often get stock from the new company if you own the original making it a bonus buy
  * Can find them [here](http://www.stockspinoffs.com/)

## Strategy

* Concentration and simplicity
  * Own a few stocks (3-4)
      * Pick a few stocks and sit on them for your life
      * Try to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be intelligent
