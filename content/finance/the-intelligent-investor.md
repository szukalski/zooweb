The Intelligent Investor  
Benjamin Graham

## Introduction

### Two Kinds of Investors

* Passive
    * Emphasis on avoidance of serious mistakes or losses
    * Freedom from effort or frequent decisions
* Active
    * Willingness to devote time and care to select securities which are both sound and more attractive than average
    * Could expect a better return than a passive investor

### Two Morals for Our Readers

1. Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not translate into obvious profits for investors
2. The experts do not have dependable ways of selecting and concentrating on the most promising companies in the most promising industries

### Three Powerful Lessons to Learn

1. How you can minimise the odds of suffering irreversible losses
2. How you can maximise the chances of achieving sustainable gains
3. How you can control the self-defeating behavious that keeps most investors from reaching their full potential

## Investment versus Speculation

* Definition:
    * An investment operation which promises safety of principal and an adequate return from thorough analysis
    * All other operations not meeting this are speculative
* Investor: Calculates what a stock is worth, based on the value of the business
* Speculator: Gambles that stock price will go up because someone will pay more for it

### Unintelligent Speculation

1. Speculating when you think you are investing
2. Speculating seriously instead of a past-time, when you lack the proper knowledge and skill for it
3. Risking more money in speculation than you can afford to lose

### The Future of Securities is Never Predictable

Since you cannot predict the behaviour of markets, you must learn how to predict and control your own behaviour

### To Enjoy a Reasonable Chance for Better than Average Results

* Follow policies which are:
    * Inherently sound and promising
    * Not popular on Wall Street

### Three Elements of Investing

1. You must thoroughly analyse a company, and the soundness of its underlying businesses, before you buy its stock
2. You must deliberately protect yourself against serious losses
3. You must aspire to "adequate" and not extraordinary performance

## A Century of Stock-Market History

### P/E Ratio

* < 10 is low
* 10-20 is moderate
* 20+ is expensive

### Bull-Market Baloney

* Never forecast the future exclusively by extrapolating the past
* The value of any investment is a funtion of the price you pay for it
* The only truth is that the future will surprise us

### Three Factors in Stock-Market Performance

1. Real Growth
    * Rise of companies' earnings and dividends
2. Inflationary Growth
    * General rise of prices in the economy
3. Speculative Growth and Decline
    * Increase of decrease in the investing public's appetite for stocks

## General Portfolio Policy: The Defensive Investor

The rate of return sought should be dependent on the amount of intelligent effort the investor is willing and able to bring to bear on the task
