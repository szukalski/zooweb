The Intelligent Investor  
Benjamin Graham

# 0 - Introduction

## Two Kinds of Investors

* Passive
    * Emphasis on avoidance of serious mistakes or losses
    * Freedom from effort or frequent decisions
* Active
    * Willingness to devote time and care to select securities which are both sound and more attractive than average
    * Could expect a better return than a passive investor

## Two Morals for Our Readers

1. Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not translate into obvious profits for investors
2. The experts do not have dependable ways of selecting and concentrating on the most promising companies in the most promising industries

## Three Powerful Lessons to Learn

1. How you can minimise the odds of suffering irreversible losses
2. How you can maximise the chances of achieving sustainable gains
3. How you can control the self-defeating behavious that keeps most investors from reaching their full potential

# 1- Investment versus Speculation

* Definition:
    * An investment operation which promises safety of principal and an adequate return from thorough analysis
    * All other operations not meeting this are speculative
* Investor: Calculates what a stock is worth, based on the value of the business
* Speculator: Gambles that stock price will go up because someone will pay more for it

## Unintelligent Speculation

1. Speculating when you think you are investing
2. Speculating seriously instead of a past-time, when you lack the proper knowledge and skill for it
3. Risking more money in speculation than you can afford to lose

## The Future of Securities is Never Predictable

Since you cannot predict the behaviour of markets, you must learn how to predict and control your own behaviour

## To Enjoy a Reasonable Chance for Better than Average Results

* Follow policies which are:
    * Inherently sound and promising
    * Not popular on Wall Street

## Three Elements of Investing

1. You must thoroughly analyse a company, and the soundness of its underlying businesses, before you buy its stock
2. You must deliberately protect yourself against serious losses
3. You must aspire to "adequate" and not extraordinary performance

# 3- A Century of Stock-Market History

## P/E Ratio

* < 10 is low
* 10-20 is moderate
* 20+ is expensive

## Bull-Market Baloney

* Never forecast the future exclusively by extrapolating the past
* The value of any investment is a funtion of the price you pay for it
* The only truth is that the future will surprise us

## Three Factors in Stock-Market Performance

1. Real Growth
    * Rise of companies' earnings and dividends
2. Inflationary Growth
    * General rise of prices in the economy
3. Speculative Growth and Decline
    * Increase of decrease in the investing public's appetite for stocks

# 4 - General Portfolio Policy: The Defensive Investor

The rate of return sought should be dependent on the amount of intelligent effort the investor is willing and able to bring to bear on the task

## Two Ways to be an Intelligent Investor

1. Active
    * Continually researching, selecting, and monitoring a dynamic mix of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds
2. Passive
    * Creating a permanent portfolio that runs on autopilot and requires no further effort

## Brave or Cave

* How much to put in stocks, and how much to put in bonds and cash?
    * **Inflation is one of your worst enemies**
* Keep a minimum 25% in bonds
    * Gives courage to keep the rest in stocks even when they are underperforming

## Bonds

### Bond Prices

* Quoted in percentages of "par value" or 100
    * A bond selling at "85" is selling at 85% of it's principal value
* Bonds selling below 100 are "discount bonds"
* Bonds selling above 100 are "premium bonds"

### Government Bonds

* Buy only tax-free bonds to avoid losing too much profit to tax
* Intermediate bonds (5-10 years) are least affected by interest rate fluctuations and the best bet
    * Interest rates rise > bond prices fall > short-term bonds fall less
    * Interest rates fall > bond prices rise > long-term bonds out-perform
* Bond funds offer cheap and easy diversification with convenient monthly income

### Government Cash-Equivalent

* Treasury securities are backed by US Government and have virtually no risk
    * T-Bills are common cash equivalent (Treasury Bills)

### Non-Government Bonds

* Mortgage debt is high-risk (think recent crash) and should be avoided
* Junk bonds have high-risk and high-yield
    * Speculative rather than investment

# 5 - The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks

## Merits of Common Stocks

* Considerable protection against inflation
    * Bonds offer no protection
* Higher historical return than bonds
    * Average dividend income exceeding bonds
    * Tendency for market value to increase
* Benefits could be lost if the buyer pays too high a price for his shares

## Rules for the Common-Stock Component

1. Adequate but not excessive diversification
    * Minimum 10 and maximum 30
2. Each company should be large, prominent, and conservatively financed
3. Each company should have a long record of continuous dividend payments
    * Minimum 10 years
4. Impose a limit on the price paid for the shares relative to average historical earnings
    * Maximum of 25x the average earnings over the last 7 years
    * Not more than 20x the earnings in the last 12-months
    * Typically excludes growth stocks

## Growth Stocks

* Growth stock has increased it's EPS (Earnings-per-Share) above the average rate and is expected to continue to do so
* Are attractive as long as the price is not too high
* Sell at high prices in relation to current earnings and average historical profits
* Better to focus on unpopular large companies which can be bought at reasonable P/E multipliers

### Rule of 72

```Math
Time taken to double money = 72 / Growth Rate

ie. 72 / 6% = 12 years
```

## Large, Prominent, and Conservatively Financed Corporations

* Large companies have a market value of at least $10B
* Prominent means in the first quarter or third in size within their industry group
* Not conservative unless the common stock represents at least half the total capitalisation, including bank debt

## The Best Defence is a Good Offence

* When stocks are priced reasonably enough to give future growth then you should own them, regardless of all losses they may have cost in the past
    * More true when bond yields are low

## Home Bias

* Investing in "What You Know" is dangerous
    * The more you know, the less likely you are to probe a stock for weaknesses

# 6 - Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: Negative Approach

## What to Avoid

* Second-grade / Junk bonds
* Emerging market debt / bonds
* Preferred Stocks
* New Issues/IPO
* Day trading
    * The more you trade the less you keep

# 7 - Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side

## Operations in Common Stocks

1. Buying in low markets and selling in high markets
    * Doesn't work
2. Buying carefully chosen growth stocks
    * No outstanding rewards compared to common stocks
        * Growth stocks are over-priced and in demand
3. Buying bargain issues of various types
4. Buying into special situations

## When to get interested in Growth Stocks

* Not when they are popular, but when something goes wrong

## To Obtain Better Than Average Investment Results

1. It must meet objective or rational test of underlying soundness
2. It must be different from the policy followed by most investors or speculators

## Three Recommended Fields for "Enterprising Investment"

1. The Relatively Unpopular Large Company
    * The market overvalues common stocks which have been showing excellent growth or are glamorous for some other reason
    * The market undervalues companies that are out of favour because of unsatisfactory developments of a temporary nature
    * **Concentrate on the larger companies that are going through a period of unpopularity**
        * Large companies are better than smaller:
            * They have resources in capital and brain power to carry them through adversity and back to satisfactory earnings
            * The market is likely to respond with reasonable speed to any improvement shown
    * Focus on the companies selling at the lowest multipliers of their current or previous year's earning
        * **Exception:** Companies which are inherently speculative sell at both a high price and low multiplier in their good years, and low price and high multiplier in their bad years
        * Start with the low multiplier test, but add other quantitative and qualitative requirements
2. Purchase of Bargain Issues
    * Appears to be worth considerably more than it is selling for, based on facts established by analysis
        * Includes bonds and common stocks
    * **Bargain issues have an indicated value at least 50% more than the price**
    * Two tests for bargain detection:
        1. Method of Appraisal
            * Estimating future earnings and multiplying by a factor appropriate to the particular issue
        2. Value of Business to a Private Owner
            * Same as 1 but with more attention to the net current assets or working capital

## Two Major Sources of Undervaluation

1. Currently Disappointing Results
2. Protracted Neglect or Unpopularity

## Requirements for Bargain Stock

* Undervaluation
* Reasonable stability in earnings over the past decade or more
* Sufficient size and financial strength to meet possible setbacks in the future

## Ideal Bargain Stock

* Large and prominent company selling well below its past average price and its past P/E multiplier
* Sells for less than the company's net working capital after deducting prior obligations
    * Current Assets - Total Liabilities

## Bargain Issue Pattern in Secondary Companies

* A secondary company is one that is not a leader in an important industry
* Investors have a preference for industry leaders and corresponding lack of interest in secondary companies
    * Secondary companies have usually sold at much lower prices in relation to earnings and assets
* No sound reason why secondary companies should not continue indefinitely in operation and earning a fair return on the invested capital

## Why Invest in Secondary Companies

1. Dividend return is relatively high
2. Reinvested earnings are substantial relative to the price paid and will ultimately affect the price
3. A bull market is normally generous to low-priced issues
4. During regular market price adjustment, secondary issues which were undervalued may rise at least to the normal level for their type
5. The specific factorys which made for a disappointing record of earnings may be corrected by the advent of new conditions, or the adoption of new policies, or by a change in management

## To Check if Stock is Selling for less than the Value of Net Working Capital

```Math
Value = Current Assets - Total Liabilities
```

* From the most recent quarterly or annual report

# 8 - The Investor and Market Fluctuations

* Fluctuations will occur
    * Short maturity bonds > little affect
    * Longer term bonds > wide price swings over their life
    * Common stocks > fluctuate over several years
* Know about these possibilities and be prepared both financially and psychologically
* Want to benefit from changes in market levels
    * **Danger of leading to speculative attitudes and activities**
        * Speculation should be separate from the investment program

## Market Fluctuations as a Guide to Investment Decisions

* Two ways to benefit from market fluctuations:
    1. Timing
        * Anticipate the action of the market
        * **SPECULATION**
        * Nothing to suggest the average investor can forecast market movements any better than the general public of which he is part of
        * Any successful trading is of no long-term value as it quickly becomes common place
        * No real value for an investor unless it enables him to repurchase his shares at substantially under his previous selling price
    2. Pricing
        * Buy stocks when their price is below their fair value and sell them when they rise above this fair value

## Market Fluctuations of the Investor's Portfolio

* Most stocks will gain at least 50% from their lowest price and lose at least 33% from their highest price
* Favour a mechanical method to varying the proportion of bonds and stocks
    * As the market advances, from time to time, make sales from stockholdings and put into bonds. As it declines, reverse the procedure
        * Provides "something to do" during these times
        * Opposite from the crowd

## Business Valuations versus Stock-Market Valuations

* Stock-holders have two advantages:
    * They are analogous to a silent partner in a private business
        * Results are dependent on the profits of the enterprise or a change in the underlying vlaue of its assets
        * Usually determines the value of his interest by calculating his share of the net worth as shown on the balance sheet
    * Holds a stock which can be sold in minutes and is often far removed from the balance sheet value
* Stock market activity is usually based on the market price and not the balance sheet value
    * The investor is dependent on the stock market to validate his commitments
* The more successful a company, the greater the fluctuations in the price of it's shares
    * The better the common stock, the more *speculative* it is likely to be

## Conclusions

* A stock does not become a sound investment merely because it can be bough at close to it's asset value
    * The investor should demand, in addition, a satisfactory ratio of P/E, a sufficiently strong financial position, and the prospect that its earnings will at least be maintained over the years
* The investor with a sotck portfolio having balance sheet values behind it can take a much more independent and detached view of stock market fluctuations than those who have paid high multipliers of both earnings and tangible assets
    * As long as the earning power of his holdings remains satisfactory, he can pay as little attention to the stock market as he pleases
    * More than that, he can use the fluctuations to his advantage to obtain bargain issues
* The true investor scarcely ever *is forced to sell* his shares, and at all other times he is free to disregard the current price quotation
    * He need pay attention only when it suits his book, and no more

## Cautions

* Two morals:
    1. The stock market often goes far wrong and sometimes an alert and courageous investor can take advantage of its errors
    2. Most businesses change in character and quality over time
        * Must review periodically

## Can you Beat the Pros at their Own Game

* Typical money managers must mimic the market:
    * With billions in management they must gravitate towards the biggest stocks
        * Only ones which can supply their multi-million dollar requirements
        * Many funds end up buying the same stocks
    * Investors tend to pour in more money as the market rises, the managers use this money to buy more stocks which they already own, driving prices even higher
        * **They are forced to buy at high prices**
    * Investors tend to withdraw money when the market drops, the managers are forced to sell stocks at deflated prices to cash them out
        * **They are forced to sell at low prices**
    * Many managers are incentivised to beat the S&P 500 index and are forced to buy any new addition to the index
    * Managers are increasingly expected to specialise
        * If a company gets too big, too small, too cheap, or too expensive then the fund must sell it even if the manager loves the stock
* **You can beat the pros, but you can't beat them at their own game!**

## Investing Intelligently is about Controlling the Controllable

* You can't control the market impact in the short run but you can control:
    * Brokerage costs
        * Trade rarely, patiently, and cheaply
    * Ownership costs
        * Refuse to buy mutual funds with excessive annual expenses
    * Expectations
        * Use realism and not fantasy to forecast returns
    * Risk
        * Decide how much of your total assets to put at hazard in the stock market, by diversifying, and by re-balancing
    * Tax Bills
        * Optimise for local requirements
    * Behaviour
* Don't compare your results against others
    * Measure your results against what you need from your financial plan

## Your Money and Your Brain

* Humans are hard-wired to get into investing trouble
    * We are pattern-seeking animals
        * Brains designed to perceive trends even where they may not exist
    * After an event occurs 2-3 times in a row, our brain automatically anticipates that it will happen again
        * If it repeats then dopamine is released
        * If it fails, or reverses, then a "fight or flight" response takes place
* The pain of financial loss is more than twice as intense as the pleasure of an equivalent gain
* **By acknowledging your biological tendency to buy-high-sell-low, you can admit the need to dollar-cost-average, rebalance, and sign an investment contract**

## Summary

* The **Speculator** interest lies in anticipating and profiting from market fluctuations
* The **Investor** interest lies in acquiring and holding suitable securities at suitable prices
    * Market movements are important in a practical sense
        * The create low price levels where it is wise to buy, and high price levels where he should refrain from buying and probably would be wise to sell
* Should not wait until low market prices appear
    * Could be a long wait, and a loss of income
    * Better to invest when he has money to, except when the general market level is much higher than can be justified by well-established standards of value
* Never buy a stock immediately after a substantial rise, or sell one immediately after a substiantial drop
* Mr Market's job is to provide you with prices; your job is to decide whether it is to your advantage to act on them

# 9 - Investing in Investment Funds

**Just work with ETFs**

# 11 - Security Analysis for the Lay Investor: General Approach

* The security analyst deals with the past, present, and future of any security issue
    * Describes the business
        * Summary of operating results and financial positions
        * Strong and weak points
        * Possibilities and risks
        * Estimated future earning power under various assumptions
    * Expresses an opinion of the safety or attractiveness of the issue
* Mathematical valuations have become most precise in the areas where they are least reliable
    * The higher the growth rate and the longer the future period projected, the more sensitive the forecast becomes to the slightest error

## Bond Analysis

* Chief criterion is the number of times that total interest charges have been covered by available earnings for some years in the past
    * *Average* results for a period of years
    * *Poorest-year* result

### Recommended Minimum Coverage for Bonds (Earnings-Coverage Test)

Type|7 yr. Avg (Pre-Income Tax)|Poorest-Year|7 yr. Avg (Post-Income Tax)|Poorest-Year
-|-|-|-|-
Public-utility operating company|4x|3x|2.65x|2.1x
Railroad|5x|4x|3.2x|2.65x
Industrial|7x|5x|4.3x|3.2x
Retail concern|5x|4x|3.2x|2.65x

### In Addition to the Earnings-Coverage Test

1. Size of Enterprise
2. Stock/Equity Ratio
    * The ratio of the common stock against debt plus preferred stock
    * Rough measure of the protection afforded to common stock if something unfavourable occurs
3. Property Value
    * The asset values shown on the balance sheet

### How Dependable are Tests of Safety Measured on Past and Present Performance

* History shows that bonds that have met the stringent tests of safety have been able to face the future successfully

## Common Stock Analysis

* Valuation of the issue which can be compared with the current price to determine whether or not the security is an attractive purchase
* Standard procedure for estimating future earnings starts with average past data and projecting these forward based on some assumptions of demand and growth
* Better to concentrate on one stock you **know** than to dilute your results for diversification's sake

### Factors Affecting the Capitalisation Rate

1. General Long Term Prospects
    * When dictated by past performance, they are as likely to be wrong as right
    * Most optimistic when stocks are over-priced, and pessimistic when they are cheapest
2. Management
    * Fair to assume an outstandingly successful company has good management
        * Shown in past results and future estimates
        * Easily leads to expensive overvaluations
    * Most useful where a recent change has taken place but has not had time to show it's significance in the actual figures
3. Financial Strength and Capital Structure
    * Stock of a company with a lot of surplus cash and nothing ahead is a better purchase (at the same price) than another one with the same EPS but large bank loans and preferred stocks
        * A moderate use of bonds and preferred stocks is not necessarily a disadvantage
4. Dividend Record
    * A continuous period of dividend payments for the last 20 years or more
5. Current Dividend Rate
    * *Dividend Payout Ratio* is the percentage of earnings paid out in dividends

### Capitalisation Rates for Growth Stocks

```Math
Value = Current (Normal) Earnings x (8.5 + 2x Expected Annual Growth Rate)
```

* Growth figure should be that expected over the next 7-10 years

#### Annual Earnings Multipliers Based on Expected Growth Rates

Expected Growth Rate|0.0%|2.5%|5.0%|7.2%|10.0%|14.3%|20.0%
-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
Growth in 10 years|0.0%|28.0%|63.0%|100.0%|159.0%|280.0%|319.0%
Multiplier of current earnings|8.5|13.5|18.5|22.9|28.5|37.1|48.5
