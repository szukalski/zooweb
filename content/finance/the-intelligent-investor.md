The Intelligent Investor  
Benjamin Graham

# 0 - Introduction

## Two Kinds of Investors

* Passive
    * Emphasis on avoidance of serious mistakes or losses
    * Freedom from effort or frequent decisions
* Active
    * Willingness to devote time and care to select securities which are both sound and more attractive than average
    * Could expect a better return than a passive investor

## Two Morals for Our Readers

1. Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not translate into obvious profits for investors
2. The experts do not have dependable ways of selecting and concentrating on the most promising companies in the most promising industries

## Three Powerful Lessons to Learn

1. How you can minimise the odds of suffering irreversible losses
2. How you can maximise the chances of achieving sustainable gains
3. How you can control the self-defeating behavious that keeps most investors from reaching their full potential

# 1- Investment versus Speculation

* Definition:
    * An investment operation which promises safety of principal and an adequate return from thorough analysis
    * All other operations not meeting this are speculative
* Investor: Calculates what a stock is worth, based on the value of the business
* Speculator: Gambles that stock price will go up because someone will pay more for it

## Unintelligent Speculation

1. Speculating when you think you are investing
2. Speculating seriously instead of a past-time, when you lack the proper knowledge and skill for it
3. Risking more money in speculation than you can afford to lose

## The Future of Securities is Never Predictable

Since you cannot predict the behaviour of markets, you must learn how to predict and control your own behaviour

## To Enjoy a Reasonable Chance for Better than Average Results

* Follow policies which are:
    * Inherently sound and promising
    * Not popular on Wall Street

## Three Elements of Investing

1. You must thoroughly analyse a company, and the soundness of its underlying businesses, before you buy its stock
2. You must deliberately protect yourself against serious losses
3. You must aspire to "adequate" and not extraordinary performance

# 3- A Century of Stock-Market History

## P/E Ratio

* < 10 is low
* 10-20 is moderate
* 20+ is expensive

## Bull-Market Baloney

* Never forecast the future exclusively by extrapolating the past
* The value of any investment is a funtion of the price you pay for it
* The only truth is that the future will surprise us

## Three Factors in Stock-Market Performance

1. Real Growth
    * Rise of companies' earnings and dividends
2. Inflationary Growth
    * General rise of prices in the economy
3. Speculative Growth and Decline
    * Increase of decrease in the investing public's appetite for stocks

# 4 - General Portfolio Policy: The Defensive Investor

The rate of return sought should be dependent on the amount of intelligent effort the investor is willing and able to bring to bear on the task

## Two Ways to be an Intelligent Investor

1. Active
    * Continually researching, selecting, and monitoring a dynamic mix of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds
2. Passive
    * Creating a permanent portfolio that runs on autopilot and requires no further effort

## Brave or Cave

* How much to put in stocks, and how much to put in bonds and cash?
    * **Inflation is one of your worst enemies**
* Keep a minimum 25% in bonds
    * Gives courage to keep the rest in stocks even when they are underperforming

## Bonds

### Bond Prices

* Quoted in percentages of "par value" or 100
    * A bond selling at "85" is selling at 85% of it's principal value
* Bonds selling below 100 are "discount bonds"
* Bonds selling above 100 are "premium bonds"

### Government Bonds

* Buy only tax-free bonds to avoid losing too much profit to tax
* Intermediate bonds (5-10 years) are least affected by interest rate fluctuations and the best bet
    * Interest rates rise > bond prices fall > short-term bonds fall less
    * Interest rates fall > bond prices rise > long-term bonds out-perform
* Bond funds offer cheap and easy diversification with convenient monthly income

### Government Cash-Equivalent

* Treasury securities are backed by US Government and have virtually no risk
    * T-Bills are common cash equivalent (Treasury Bills)

### Non-Government Bonds

* Mortgage debt is high-risk (think recent crash) and should be avoided
* Junk bonds have high-risk and high-yield
    * Speculative rather than investment

# 5 - The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks

## Merits of Common Stocks

* Considerable protection against inflation
    * Bonds offer no protection
* Higher historical return than bonds
    * Average dividend income exceeding bonds
    * Tendency for market value to increase
* Benefits could be lost if the buyer pays too high a price for his shares

## Rules for the Common-Stock Component

1. Adequate but not excessive diversification
    * Minimum 10 and maximum 30
2. Each company should be large, prominent, and conservatively financed
3. Each company should have a long record of continuous dividend payments
    * Minimum 10 years
4. Impose a limit on the price paid for the shares relative to average historical earnings
    * Maximum of 25x the average earnings over the last 7 years
    * Not more than 20x the earnings in the last 12-months
    * Typically excludes growth stocks

## Growth Stocks

* Growth stock has increased it's EPS (Earnings-per-Share) above the average rate and is expected to continue to do so
* Are attractive as long as the price is not too high
* Sell at high prices in relation to current earnings and average historical profits
* Better to focus on unpopular large companies which can be bought at reasonable P/E multipliers

### Rule of 72

```Math
Time taken to double money = 72 / Growth Rate

ie. 72 / 6% = 12 years
```

## Large, Prominent, and Conservatively Financed Corporations

* Large companies have a market value of at least $10B
* Prominent means in the first quarter or third in size within their industry group
* Not conservative unless the common stock represents at least half the total capitalisation, including bank debt

## The Best Defence is a Good Offence

* When stocks are priced reasonably enough to give future growth then you should own them, regardless of all losses they may have cost in the past
    * More true when bond yields are low

## Home Bias

* Investing in "What You Know" is dangerous
    * The more you know, the less likely you are to probe a stock for weaknesses

# 6 - Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: Negative Approach

## What to Avoid

* Second-grade / Junk bonds
* Emerging market debt / bonds
* Preferred Stocks
* New Issues/IPO
* Day trading
    * The more you trade the less you keep

# 7 - Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side

## Operations in Common Stocks

1. Buying in low markets and selling in high markets
    * Doesn't work
2. Buying carefully chosen growth stocks
    * No outstanding rewards compared to common stocks
        * Growth stocks are over-priced and in demand
3. Buying bargain issues of various types
4. Buying into special situations

## When to get interested in Growth Stocks

* Not when they are popular, but when something goes wrong

## To Obtain Better Than Average Investment Results

1. It must meet objective or rational test of underlying soundness
2. It must be different from the policy followed by most investors or speculators

## Three Recommended Fields for "Enterprising Investment"

1. The Relatively Unpopular Large Company
    * The market overvalues common stocks which have been showing excellent growth or are glamorous for some other reason
    * The market undervalues companies that are out of favour because of unsatisfactory developments of a temporary nature
    * **Concentrate on the larger companies that are going through a period of unpopularity**
        * Large companies are better than smaller:
            * They have resources in capital and brain power to carry them through adversity and back to satisfactory earnings
            * The market is likely to respond with reasonable speed to any improvement shown
    * Focus on the companies selling at the lowest multipliers of their current or previous year's earning
        * **Exception:** Companies which are inherently speculative sell at both a high price and low multiplier in their good years, and low price and high multiplier in their bad years
        * Start with the low multiplier test, but add other quantitative and qualitative requirements
2. Purchase of Bargain Issues
    * Appears to be worth considerably more than it is selling for, based on facts established by analysis
        * Includes bonds and common stocks
    * **Bargain issues have an indicated value at least 50% more than the price**
    * Two tests for bargain detection:
        1. Method of Appraisal
            * Estimating future earnings and multiplying by a factor appropriate to the particular issue
        2. Value of Business to a Private Owner
            * Same as 1 but with more attention to the net current assets or working capital

## Two Major Sources of Undervaluation

1. Currently Disappointing Results
2. Protracted Neglect or Unpopularity

## Requirements for Bargain Stock

* Undervaluation
* Reasonable stability in earnings over the past decade or more
* Sufficient size and financial strength to meet possible setbacks in the future

## Ideal Bargain Stock

* Large and prominent company selling well below its past average price and its past P/E multiplier
* Sells for less than the company's net working capital after deducting prior obligations
    * Current Assets - Total Liabilities

## Bargain Issue Pattern in Secondary Companies

* A secondary company is one that is not a leader in an important industry
* Investors have a preference for industry leaders and corresponding lack of interest in secondary companies
    * Secondary companies have usually sold at much lower prices in relation to earnings and assets
* No sound reason why secondary companies should not continue indefinitely in operation and earning a fair return on the invested capital

## Why Invest in Secondary Companies

1. Dividend return is relatively high
2. Reinvested earnings are substantial relative to the price paid and will ultimately affect the price
3. A bull market is normally generous to low-priced issues
4. During regular market price adjustment, secondary issues which were undervalued may rise at least to the normal level for their type
5. The specific factorys which made for a disappointing record of earnings may be corrected by the advent of new conditions, or the adoption of new policies, or by a change in management

## To Check if Stock is Selling for less than the Value of Net Working Capital

```Math
Value = Current Assets - Total Liabilities
```

* From the most recent quarterly or annual report

# 8 - The Investor and Market Fluctuations

* Fluctuations will occur
    * Short maturity bonds > little affect
    * Longer term bonds > wide price swings over their life
    * Common stocks > fluctuate over several years
* Know about these possibilities and be prepared both financially and psychologically
* Want to benefit from changes in market levels
    * **Danger of leading to speculative attitudes and activities**
        * Speculation should be separate from the investment program

## Market Fluctuations as a Guide to Investment Decisions

* Two ways to benefit from market fluctuations:
    1. Timing
        * Anticipate the action of the market
        * **SPECULATION**
        * Nothing to suggest the average investor can forecast market movements any better than the general public of which he is part of
        * Any successful trading is of no long-term value as it quickly becomes common place
        * No real value for an investor unless it enables him to repurchase his shares at substantially under his previous selling price
    2. Pricing
        * Buy stocks when their price is below their fair value and sell them when they rise above this fair value

## Market Fluctuations of the Investor's Portfolio

* Most stocks will gain at least 50% from their lowest price and lose at least 33% from their highest price
* Favour a mechanical method to varying the proportion of bonds and stocks
    * As the market advances, from time to time, make sales from stockholdings and put into bonds. As it declines, reverse the procedure
        * Provides "something to do" during these times
        * Opposite from the crowd
