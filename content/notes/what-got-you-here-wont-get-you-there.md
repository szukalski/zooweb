The annoying habits are all about sharing or withholding information or emotion

Always ask the questions:

# Feedback

## Unsolicited Feedback

Find the knowledge which is unknown to us but known to others.

## Observational Feedback

* Make a list of people's casual remarks about you
  * Review the list as positives or negatives
  * Search for persisting negatives
* Turn the sound off
  * Look for physical behaviour
* Complete the sentence

  * When benefits turn to something personal and meaningful then you have confirmation that this is the right thing to fix
* Listen to your self-aggrandising remarks
  * Believe the opposite of any self-aggrandising or self-deprecating remarks
* Look homeward
  * Flaws at work don't vanish when you go home
